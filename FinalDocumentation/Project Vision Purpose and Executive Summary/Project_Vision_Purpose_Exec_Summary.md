#### Purpose and vision of this Software

The purpose of CapConnect is to become a content management system  for university departments to showcase their capstone with the goal of being connected to industry sponsors. CapConnect seeks to provide a centralized place between industry and higher education, where sponsors can browse for a capstone they are interested in sponsoring. A sponsor's ability to filter capstones by multiple parameters allows for easy matching, and a sponsor's ability to quickly view the capstones they are currently sponsoring creates easy centralized access. A professor or students' ability to create and edit capstones provide a clear entry ticket to be showcased. Furthermore, Capconnect's authentication and security allow for a safe, private website to host information.

# Gotchas and Lessons Learned

1. One big thing is communication, it needs be be happening constantly throughout the project to make sure everyone is on the same page. 
2. When having to explain things to teammates, follow up with them to make sure they are not stuck on something for days that is an easy fix. 
3. When something has you stuck for a long time reach out to the person with more experience because they may be able to fix it quickly and save everyone a ton of time. 
4. Everyone should have knowledge of the full stack of the development environment, however delegating tasks to those with the most experience makes thing much more efficient. 
5. Knowledge of teams members strengths and weaknesses to best delegate work in the beginning would be a huge benefit. 
6. We should have done much more planning at the beginning on the specific design process, so that we weren't just figuring out design as we went. 
7. There needed to be a more clear use case story on some things, like how to become a sponsor, in the beginning so we weren't just trying to fit it in when it required refactoring of existing code. 
8. Teams is an awesome way of communicating and video calling a team member to collaborate. 
9. Close contact collaboration is super key and makes things flow together much more smoothly than trying to just work separately as possible.

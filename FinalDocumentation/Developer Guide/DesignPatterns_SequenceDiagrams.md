### Design Patterns

While working on this project, we were able to learn a lot about ReactJS and how it has certain design principles, techniques and design patterns in place to make the development process easier. Some of the ReactJS design patterns we used in this project are Composition, Higher-order components, and One-way direction data flow. Composition was used in order to better organize and categorize the functionality we wanted to provide through the application. Using this approach, we were able to nest components which then gave easier access to them when they are later needed. We also used higher-order components to help design the way components were handled within another component. For example, we would have an index component in which using a condition it would determine which component to be directed to next, with the index component being the higher-order. This approach allowed us to have a source layout that better aligned with the pages provided. The React pattern, one-way direction data flow, was also used throughout the project. Using this pattern, we were able to separate the changes needed to be made to data when a certain action or function occurred from the page being rendered by the component. Though these are just some of the design patterns used, through this project we were better able to understand different ReactJS design patterns and principles, which we could then apply towards the application.
